[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findfstream.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "fstream", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "fstream" with any
  of the following names:

    fstreamConfig.cmake
    fstream-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "fstream" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "fstream_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "fstream" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
